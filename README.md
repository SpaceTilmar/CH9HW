Compiler contains spillage via warnings.
Can't start names with a number/reserved word
An object reference varialbe holds bits that represent a way to access an object.
AN object reference is just another varialble value.

Imagine an array like a tray of cups
Arrays are objects too whether they hold primitives or reference vars.

# Chapter 4

State affects behavior, behavior affects state
Class describes what an object knows and what an object does (BLUEPRINT)
Method uses parameters, caller passes arguments. (Send things to a method)
Getters and Setters = Accessors and Mutators
Encapsulation is protecting variables from being messed with outside of intended boundaries.
Mark instances variables private. Getters and Setters public.
Any place where a particular value can be used, a method call that returns that type can be used.
Instance variables are declared in a class but not a method. Local variables are declared within a method
Local variables have no default value.
Local variables must be initialized before use.
